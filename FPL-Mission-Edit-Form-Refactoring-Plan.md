# FPL Mission Edit Form Refactoring Plan

## Initial File Review
- [ ] Review `app/dashboard/fpl-missions/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
- [ ] Review `app/api/fpl-missions/[id]/route.ts`
- [ ] Review `app/middleware/rbac.ts`
- [ ] Review `app/utils/auth.ts`
- [ ] Review `lib/prisma.ts`
- [ ] Review `app/hooks/useApi.ts`

## Server Component Conversion
- [ ] Remove 'use client' directive from `app/dashboard/fpl-missions/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
- [ ] Implement server-side data fetching
- [ ] Add RBAC checks within the Server Component

## Client Component Creation
- [ ] Plan the structure for new file: `components/EditFPLMissionForm.tsx`
- [ ] Identify form logic and state management to move to this new Client Component
- [ ] Ensure 'use client' directive is included in the plan for this new component

## Server Component (page.tsx) Update
- [ ] Plan server-side mission data fetching
- [ ] Design data passing to the new EditFPLMissionForm component
- [ ] Plan handling of loading and error states server-side

## Params Handling Correction
- [ ] In the Server Component plan, ensure `params.id` is accessed directly without using React.use()
- [ ] Plan proper typing for params

## Global RBAC Middleware Update
- [ ] Plan modifications to `app/middleware/rbac.ts` to use getServerSession
- [ ] Design middleware configuration to apply only to specific API routes
- [ ] Plan implementation of proper error handling and logging in middleware

## API Routes RBAC Cleanup
- [ ] Plan updates for `app/api/fpl-missions/[id]/route.ts` to remove local RBAC checks
- [ ] Ensure plan covers all API routes under /api/fpl-missions/ with global middleware

## auth() Function Review and Update
- [ ] Analyze `app/utils/auth.ts` for correct implementation
- [ ] Consider plan for replacing with direct use of getServerSession if necessary
- [ ] Ensure auth function plan is designed for server-side usage

## API Route Handlers Update
- [ ] Plan simplification of API routes in `app/api/fpl-missions/[id]/route.ts`
- [ ] Design removal of any remaining local RBAC checks
- [ ] Plan proper error handling in each route handler

## Form Submission Logic Update
- [ ] Design updates for form submission in planned EditFPLMissionForm component
- [ ] Plan implementation of proper error handling for form submission
- [ ] Design addition of loading state during form submission

## Error Handling and Loading States
- [ ] Plan implementation of error boundaries where appropriate
- [ ] Design addition of loading indicators for asynchronous operations
- [ ] Plan for user-friendly error messages

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Design tests for edit page functionality with various user roles
- [ ] Plan verification of RBAC for all routes
- [ ] Design tests for form submission and data fetching
- [ ] Plan tests for error scenarios and loading states

## Code Cleanup Strategy
- [ ] Plan removal of any unused imports or code
- [ ] Design strategy for ensuring consistent coding style across all modified files
- [ ] Plan updates for comments and documentation where necessary

## Final Review Process
- [ ] Design process for final code review of all changes
- [ ] Plan verification that all checklist items have been addressed
- [ ] Design test plan for entire flow from accessing edit page to successful form submission

## Implementation
- [ ] After all planning and review steps are complete, begin actual implementation of changes
- [ ] Create new files as planned
- [ ] Modify existing files according to the plan
- [ ] Implement all planned changes step by step

## Post-Implementation Review
- [ ] Conduct thorough review of all implemented changes
- [ ] Verify that all planned modifications have been correctly executed
- [ ] Perform final testing of the entire system to ensure proper functionality
