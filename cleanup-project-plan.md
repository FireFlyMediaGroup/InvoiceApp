**Note:** This timeline is an estimate and may vary based on the project's complexity and team size. It's recommended to adjust the plan as needed during the cleanup process.

## Next Steps:
1. Review this plan with the development team
2. Prioritize tasks and assign responsibilities
3. Set up a project board (e.g., in GitHub Projects or Jira) to track progress
4. Schedule regular check-ins to address any challenges or blockers

By following this plan, you'll systematically clean up the InvoiceApp project, improving its overall quality, maintainability, and scalability.
