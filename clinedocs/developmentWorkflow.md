# Development Workflow

This document outlines the development process, git workflow, and coding standards for our project.

## Development Process

1. **Issue Tracking**: All tasks, bugs, and feature requests are tracked using GitHub Issues.

2. **Branch Strategy**:
   - `main`: The main branch contains the production-ready code.
   - `develop`: The development branch where features are integrated.
   - Feature branches: Created for each new feature or bug fix.

3. **Feature Development**:
   - Create a new branch from `develop` for each feature or bug fix.
   - Name the branch using the convention: `feature/[feature-name]` or `bugfix/[bug-description]`.
   - Develop and test the feature locally.

4. **Code Review**:
   - Create a Pull Request (PR) from your feature branch to `develop`.
   - Assign reviewers to the PR.
   - Address any comments or feedback from the review.
   - Once approved, merge the PR into `develop`.

5. **Testing**:
   - Run unit tests locally before creating a PR.
   - Ensure all tests pass in the CI pipeline before merging.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Merges to `develop` trigger automatic deployment to the staging environment.
   - After thorough testing in staging, create a PR from `develop` to `main`.
   - Merges to `main` trigger automatic deployment to the production environment.

## Git Workflow

1. **Starting a New Feature**:
   ```
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]
   ```

2. **Making Commits**:
   - Make small, focused commits with clear commit messages.
   - Use the format: "Type: Brief description" for commit messages.
   - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

3. **Pushing Changes**:
   ```
   git push origin feature/[feature-name]
   ```

4. **Creating a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the GitHub repository and create a new PR.
   - Fill out the PR template with all necessary information.

5. **Updating a PR**:
   - Make requested changes locally.
   - Commit and push the changes to the same branch.
   - The PR will update automatically.

6. **Merging a PR**:
   - Use the "Squash and merge" option to keep the commit history clean.
   - Delete the feature branch after merging.

## Coding Standards

1. **General**:
   - Use consistent indentation (2 spaces).
   - Keep lines under 100 characters long.
   - Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.

2. **TypeScript**:
   - Use TypeScript for all new code.
   - Enable strict mode in TypeScript configuration.
   - Use interfaces for object shapes.

3. **React**:
   - Use functional components and hooks.
   - Keep components small and focused.
   - Use prop-types for components that don't use TypeScript.

4. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for all new functions and components.
   - Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical paths.

5. **API**:
   - Follow RESTful conventions for API endpoints.
   - Use camelCase for JSON property names.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Document all public functions and components.
   - Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes.

7. **Code Formatting**:
   - Use Prettier for automatic code formatting.
   - Run Prettier before committing code.

8. **Linting**:
   - Use ESLint with the project's defined rules.
   - Fix all linting errors before creating a PR.

By following these guidelines, we ensure consistency across the project and make it easier for team members to collaborate effectively.
