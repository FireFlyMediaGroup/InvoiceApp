# Technical Overview

## System Architecture

Our application is built using a modern web development stack, designed for scalability, maintainability, and performance. Here's an overview of the key components:

1. **Frontend**
   - Framework: Next.js (React-based)
   - Styling: Tailwind CSS
   - State Management: React Hooks
   - Form Handling: React Hook Form with Zod for validation

2. **Backend**
   - Runtime: Node.js
   - API Framework: Next.js API Routes
   - Database ORM: Prisma

3. **Database**
   - Primary Database: PostgreSQL

4. **Authentication**
   - System: NextAuth.js

5. **Testing**
   - Unit Testing: Jest
   - Integration Testing: Jest with Supertest
   - End-to-End Testing: Cypress or Playwright (to be implemented)

6. **Deployment**
   - Platform: (To be specified - e.g., Vercel, AWS, etc.)

## Key Components

1. **Dashboard**
   - Central hub for user interactions
   - Includes navigation to Invoices, POWRA, and FPL Missions

2. **Invoicing System**
   - Allows creation, editing, and management of invoices
   - Integrates with payment tracking and financial reporting

3. **POWRA (Plan of Work Risk Assessment)**
   - Facilitates creation and management of work risk assessments

4. **FPL (Field Protection and Logistics) Missions**
   - New feature for managing field missions
   - Includes Tailboard Documents, Risk Matrices, and Mission Planning Scripts

5. **User Management**
   - Handles user registration, authentication, and authorization
   - Implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with the frontend components
2. Frontend components make API calls to the backend
3. Backend API routes handle requests, interact with the database via Prisma ORM
4. Database stores and retrieves data as needed
5. Backend sends responses back to the frontend
6. Frontend updates its state and re-renders as necessary

## Security Measures

1. Authentication handled by NextAuth.js
2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implemented in middleware
3. API routes protected with appropriate authorization checks
4. Data validation using Zod schemas

## Scalability Considerations

1. Database indexing for optimized queries
2. Pagination implemented for large data sets
3. Potential for implementing caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) in the future
4. Consideration for serverless deployment for auto-scaling

## Monitoring and Logging

1. Custom monitoring utility implemented in `app/utils/monitoring.ts`
2. (Specific logging and monitoring tools to be specified - e.g., Sentry, Datadog, etc.)

This technical overview provides a high-level understanding of the system architecture. Developers should refer to specific documentation files for more detailed information on each component.
