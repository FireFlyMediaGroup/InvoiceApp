# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach for our project, covering unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

## Overview

Our testing strategy aims to ensure high code quality, catch bugs early in the development process, and maintain the reliability of our application. We employ a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to achieve comprehensive coverage.

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests

- **Purpose**: Test individual functions, methods, and components in isolation.
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Location**: `__tests__` directory, co-located with the source files
- **Naming Convention**: `[filename].test.ts` or `[filename].test.tsx`

#### Guidelines:
- Write unit tests for all new functions and components.
- Focus on testing the logic and behavior, not the implementation details.
- Use mocks for external dependencies and services.
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical paths.

### 2. Integration Tests

- **Purpose**: Test the interaction between different parts of the application.
- **Tools**: Jest, Supertest (for API testing)
- **Location**: `__tests__/integration` directory
- **Naming Convention**: `[feature].test.ts`

#### Guidelines:
- Write integration tests for API routes and database interactions.
- Test the flow of data through multiple units.
- Use a test database for database-related tests.
- Focus on testing critical user flows and business logic.

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests

- **Purpose**: Test the entire application from the user's perspective.
- **Tools**: Cypress or Playwright (to be implemented)
- **Location**: `e2e` directory (to be created)
- **Naming Convention**: `[feature].spec.ts`

#### Guidelines:
- Write E2E tests for critical user journeys.
- Test across different browsers and screen sizes.
- Use realistic test data that mimics production scenarios.
- Keep E2E tests focused and not too numerous to maintain reasonable execution times.

## Test Coverage

- Aim for at least 80% code coverage for unit and integration tests.
- Use Jest's coverage reports to identify areas needing more tests.
- Focus on covering critical paths and edge cases rather than achieving 100% coverage.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

- All tests are run in the CI pipeline for every pull request.
- PRs cannot be merged if tests are failing.
- Coverage reports are generated and reviewed as part of the CI process.

## Test Data Management

- Use factories or fixtures to generate test data.
- Maintain a separate test database for integration tests.
- Reset the test database before each test run to ensure a clean state.

## Mocking

- Use Jest's mocking capabilities for unit tests.
- For integration tests, consider using tools like `nock` for mocking HTTP requests.
- Create mock services for external APIs to avoid depending on third-party services in tests.

## Performance Testing

- Implement performance tests for critical API endpoints.
- Use tools like Apache JMeter or k6 for load testing (to be implemented).
- Set performance benchmarks and regularly test against them.

## Accessibility Testing

- Incorporate accessibility checks in our E2E tests.
- Use tools like axe-core with Cypress for automated accessibility testing.
- Regularly conduct manual accessibility audits.

## Security Testing

- Implement security-focused tests, especially for authentication and authorization flows.
- Regularly update and run security lint rules.
- Consider incorporating automated security scanning tools in the CI pipeline.

## Best Practices

1. Write tests before or alongside writing the actual code (TDD/BDD approach).
2. Keep tests simple, readable, and maintainable.
3. Don't test third-party libraries or frameworks, focus on your own code.
4. Regularly refactor tests along with the source code.
5. Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior.
6. Avoid test interdependence - each test should be able to run independently.

## Review and Improvement

- Regularly review and update this testing strategy.
- Encourage team members to suggest improvements to the testing process.
- Stay updated with new testing tools and methodologies in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem.

By following this testing strategy, we aim to maintain high code quality, catch bugs early, and ensure the reliability and performance of our application throughout its development lifecycle.
