## Next Steps

1. Implement the specific API routes for risk matrix, mission planning script, and tailboard document.
2. Add approval functionality for PENDING missions in both backend and frontend.
3. Implement the form components (MissionPlanningScriptForm, RiskMatrixForm, TailboardDocumentForm) as stub pages with basic RBAC.
4. Enhance error handling in API routes and add error boundaries to React components.
5. Start writing unit tests for existing components and API routes.
6. Implement proper RBAC checks in all components and routes.
7. Begin documentation process for user guide and API endpoints.
