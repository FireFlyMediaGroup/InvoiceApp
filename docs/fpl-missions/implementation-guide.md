# FPL Mission Planning Feature - Implementation Guide

## Overview

The FPL Mission Planning feature allows multiple technicians to manage their missions at various sites. Each mission consists of:

1. Risk Calculation Matrix (completed once, pre-start)
2. Mission Planning Script (completed once, pre-start)
3. Tailboard Documents (completed daily per tech after approval)

## Components Implemented

1. FPLMissionsList (app/components/FPLMissions/List/FPLMissionsList.tsx)
   - Displays a list of FPL missions
   - Allows viewing and approving missions based on user role

2. StatusBadge (app/components/FPLMissions/Status/StatusBadge.tsx)
   - Displays the status of a mission or document with appropriate styling

3. RiskMatrixForm (app/components/FPLMissions/Forms/RiskMatrixForm.tsx)
   - Form for creating and editing Risk Calculation Matrix

4. MissionPlanningScriptForm (app/components/FPLMissions/Forms/MissionPlanningScriptForm.tsx)
   - Form for creating and editing Mission Planning Script

5. TailboardDocumentForm (app/components/FPLMissions/Forms/TailboardDocumentForm.tsx)
   - Form for creating and editing Tailboard Documents

## Next Steps

1. Implement API routes for CRUD operations on FPL missions and related documents
2. Create pages for displaying and managing FPL missions
3. Integrate the components with the API and state management
4. Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for the FPL mission feature
5. Add comprehensive error handling and validation
6. Implement unit and integration tests for all components and API routes

## Testing

Basic unit tests should be created for each component to ensure they render correctly and handle user interactions as expected. Integration tests should also be implemented to test the full workflow of creating and managing FPL missions.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that all user inputs are properly validated and sanitized
- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks for all API routes
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize database queries for listing and retrieving FPL missions
- Implement pagination for the FPLMissionsList component
- Consider using server-side rendering or static site generation for improved initial load times

## Accessibility

- Ensure all forms are keyboard accessible
- Add proper ARIA labels to improve screen reader compatibility
- Maintain sufficient color contrast for all UI elements

Remember to update this guide as the implementation progresses and new considerations arise.
