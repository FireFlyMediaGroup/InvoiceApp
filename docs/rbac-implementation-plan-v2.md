# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the specific changes, tasks, and progress for implementing the role-based access control system in our application. It serves as a comprehensive guide for all developers working on this feature, ensuring consistency and clarity throughout the implementation process.

## Objectives
- Implement a robust RBAC system with three roles: User, Supervisor, and Admin
- Ensure secure access control across the application
- Maintain flexibility for future role additions or permission adjustments

## Changes to be Made

1. Database Schema
2. Authentication Configuration
3. Middleware Implementation
4. Frontend Components
5. API Routes
6. User Management
7. Logging and Monitoring
8. Testing and Quality Assurance

## Detailed Tasks and Progress

### 1. Database Schema
- [x] Add 'role' field to User model in Prisma schema (enum: 'USER', 'SUPERVISOR', 'ADMIN')
- [x] Create a migration file to update the database (npx prisma migrate dev --name add_user_roles)
- [x] Apply the migration to the development database
- [x] Update seed data to include roles (if applicable)
- [x] Document the new schema changes in the project's database documentation

### 2. Authentication Configuration
- [x] Modify auth.ts to include role in the session:
  - [x] Update the ExtendedUser interface to include the role field
  - [x] Modify the session callback to fetch and include the user's role
- [x] Add authorized callback to check user roles:
  - [x] Implement logic to check user roles against required roles for routes
  - [x] Handle cases where a user's role doesn't meet the required access level
- [x] Update signIn callback to handle roles:
  - [x] Fetch the user's role during the sign-in process
  - [x] Include role information in the JWT token (if using JWT strategy)
- [x] Update session callback to include role information:
  - [x] Ensure role information is consistently available in the session object
- [x] Document all changes made to the authentication configuration

### 3. Middleware Implementation
- [ ] Evaluate the need for additional middleware given the authorized callback implementation:
  - [ ] Review the current authorized callback in auth.ts
  - [ ] Determine if separate middleware is necessary for specific routes
- [ ] If needed, create a new middleware function for role-based access control:
  - [ ] Implement in utils/auth-middleware.ts
  - [ ] Design the middleware to be flexible and reusable across different routes
- [ ] Add middleware to protected routes (if separate middleware is implemented):
  - [ ] Identify all routes that require role-based protection
  - [ ] Apply the middleware to these routes in the appropriate order
- [ ] Document the middleware implementation and usage instructions

### 4. Frontend Components
- [ ] Create separate dashboard views for each role (User, Supervisor, Admin):
  - [ ] Implement UserDashboard component
  - [ ] Implement SupervisorDashboard component
  - [ ] Implement AdminDashboard component
- [ ] Implement conditional rendering based on user roles:
  - [ ] Create a higher-order component or hook for role-based rendering
  - [ ] Apply role-based rendering to navigation, buttons, and other UI elements
- [ ] Update navigation components to show/hide based on user role:
  - [ ] Modify the main navigation component to respect user roles
  - [ ] Ensure that role-specific navigation items are properly hidden/shown
- [ ] Create admin-only components for user management:
  - [ ] Implement UserManagement component for Admin dashboard
  - [ ] Create forms for user creation and role modification
- [ ] Document all new components and their role-based behavior

### 5. API Routes
- [ ] Modify form creation/editing routes to check user roles:
  - [ ] Update POST /api/forms to respect user roles
  - [ ] Update PUT /api/forms/:id to check user permissions
- [ ] Update form retrieval routes to filter based on user role:
  - [ ] Modify GET /api/forms to return appropriate forms based on user role
  - [ ] Implement role-based filtering logic in the database queries
- [ ] Implement role checks in user management routes:
  - [ ] Create POST /api/users for admin user creation
  - [ ] Implement PUT /api/users/:id for role modifications
- [ ] Add role-based checks to any other sensitive operations:
  - [ ] Identify all routes that require role-based access control
  - [ ] Implement consistent role checking across these routes
- [ ] Document all API route changes and their role requirements

### 6. User Management
- [ ] Create admin-only route for user creation:
  - [ ] Implement POST /api/users with role validation
  - [ ] Create UserCreationForm component for the Admin dashboard
- [ ] Implement interface for admins to change user roles:
  - [ ] Create UserRoleManagement component
  - [ ] Implement PUT /api/users/:id/role for role updates
- [ ] Add validation to ensure at least one admin always exists:
  - [ ] Implement a check in the role change API to prevent removal of the last admin
  - [ ] Add a similar check in the user deletion process (if applicable)
- [ ] Document user management features and admin responsibilities

### 7. Logging and Monitoring
- [ ] Implement detailed logging for role-based actions:
  - [ ] Set up a logging service (e.g., Winston) if not already in place
  - [ ] Log all role-based access attempts, including successes and failures
- [ ] Create a system to alert admins of suspicious role-based activities:
  - [ ] Implement an alert mechanism for multiple failed access attempts
  - [ ] Set up notifications for important role changes (e.g., new admin creation)
- [ ] Set up monitoring for failed access attempts due to insufficient roles:
  - [ ] Integrate with application monitoring tool (e.g., Sentry, New Relic)
  - [ ] Create dashboards to visualize role-based access patterns
- [ ] Document the logging and monitoring setup, including how to access and interpret logs

### 8. Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Develop unit tests for role-based logic:
  - [ ] Test role checking functions
  - [ ] Test authorized callback behavior
- [ ] Implement integration tests for role-based API routes:
  - [ ] Test form creation, editing, and retrieval with different user roles
  - [ ] Test user management routes
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for role-based user journeys:
  - [ ] Test user workflows for each role (User, Supervisor, Admin)
  - [ ] Verify correct access and restrictions for each role
- [ ] Perform security testing:
  - [ ] Attempt to bypass role-based restrictions
  - [ ] Test for common security vulnerabilities (e.g., privilege escalation)
- [ ] Document all test cases and instructions for running tests

## Best Practices for Developers

1. Security First: Always implement role checks on both client and server sides to ensure robust security.
2. Principle of Least Privilege: Grant users the minimum level of access required for their role.
3. Consistent Implementation: Use the established authorized callback and any additional middleware consistently across the application.
4. Performance Consideration: Optimize role checks to minimize impact on application performance, especially for frequently accessed routes.
5. Thorough Testing: Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all role-based functionality.
6. Clear Documentation: Keep this document and all related documentation up-to-date as changes are made.
7. Code Reviews: Ensure all role-based implementation changes undergo thorough peer review.
8. Audit Trail: Maintain detailed logs of all role-based actions for security auditing purposes.
9. User Experience: Consider the UX implications of role-based access, providing clear feedback when access is denied.
10. Scalability: Design the RBAC system to be easily extendable for future role additions or permission changes.

## Potential Challenges and Mitigations

1. Challenge: Ensuring consistent role checks across the application
   Mitigation: Utilize the authorized callback in auth.ts and develop additional middleware if necessary

2. Challenge: Performance impact of frequent role checks
   Mitigation: Implement caching strategies and optimize database queries

3. Challenge: Maintaining flexibility for future role changes
   Mitigation: Design a modular RBAC system that allows easy addition or modification of roles

4. Challenge: Preventing privilege escalation vulnerabilities
   Mitigation: Implement strict validation on role change operations and regularly perform security audits

5. Challenge: Handling existing users during RBAC implementation
   Mitigation: Develop a migration strategy to assign appropriate roles to existing users

Remember to update this document as you progress through the implementation. This will help maintain clear communication among the development team and ensure that all aspects of the role-based access control system are properly implemented.
