This document outlines the specific changes, tasks, and progress for implementing the role-based access control system in our application. It serves as a comprehensive guide for all developers working on this feature, ensuring consistency and clarity throughout the implementation process.

## Objectives
- Implement a robust RBAC system with three roles: User, Supervisor, and Admin
- Ensure secure access control across the application
- Maintain flexibility for future role additions or permission adjustments

## Changes to be Made

1. Database Schema
2. Authentication Configuration
3. Middleware Implementation
4. Frontend Components
5. API Routes
6. User Management
7. Logging and Monitoring
8. Testing and Quality Assurance

## Detailed Tasks and Progress

### 1. Database Schema

- [x] Document all changes made to the authentication configuration

### 3. Middleware Implementation
- [x] Evaluate the need for additional middleware given the authorized callback implementation:

### 4. Frontend Components
- [x] Review existing dashboard implementation for the User role
- [x] Modify existing dashboard (app/dashboard/page.tsx) to incorporate role-based access control:
  - [x] Add role checks to determine which components to render
  - [x] Ensure that user-specific data is properly filtered based on roles

  - [x] Update POST /api/powra to respect user roles
  - [x] Update PUT /api/powra to respect user roles
  - [x] Update DELETE /api/powra to respect user roles
- [x] Implement role checks in user management routes:
  - [x] Create POST /api/users for admin user creation
  - [x] Implement PUT /api/users/:id for role modifications
- [x] Add role-based checks to any other sensitive operations:
  - [x] Identify all remaining routes that require role-based access control
  - [x] Implement consistent role checking across these routes
- [x] Document all API route changes and their role requirements

### 6. User Management
- [x] Create admin-only route for user creation:
  - [x] Implement POST /api/users with role validation
  - [x] Create UserCreationForm component for the Admin dashboard
- [x] Implement interface for admins to change user roles:
  - [x] Create UserRoleManagement component
  - [x] Implement PUT /api/users/:id/role for role updates
- [x] Add validation to ensure at least one admin always exists:
  - [x] Implement a check in the role change API to prevent removal of the last admin
  - [x] Add a similar check in the user deletion process (if applicable)
- [x] Document user management features and admin responsibilities

### 7. Logging and Monitoring
- [x] Implement detailed logging for role-based actions:
  - [x] Set up a logging service (using console.log for now)
  - [x] Log all role-based access attempts, including successes and failures
- [x] Create a system to alert admins of suspicious role-based activities:
  - [x] Implement an alert mechanism for multiple failed access attempts
  - [x] Set up notifications for important role changes (e.g., new admin creation)

6. Prepare for deployment

## Best Practices for Developers

1. Security First: Always implement role checks on both client and server sides to ensure robust security.
2. Principle of Least Privilege: Grant users the minimum level of access required for their role.
3. Consistent Implementation: Use the established authorized callback and rbacMiddleware consistently across the application.
4. Performance Consideration: Optimize role checks to minimize impact on application performance, especially for frequently accessed routes.
5. Thorough Testing: Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all role-based functionality.
6. Clear Documentation: Keep this document and all related documentation up-to-date as changes are made.
7. Code Reviews: Ensure all role-based implementation changes undergo thorough peer review.
8. Audit Trail: Maintain detailed logs of all role-based actions for security auditing purposes.
9. User Experience: Consider the UX implications of role-based access, providing clear feedback when access is denied.
10. Scalability: Design the RBAC system to be easily extendable for future role additions or permission changes.

## Potential Challenges and Mitigations

1. Challenge: Ensuring consistent role checks across the application
   Mitigation: Utilize the authorized callback in auth.ts and rbacMiddleware consistently

2. Challenge: Performance impact of frequent role checks
   Mitigation: Implement caching strategies and optimize database queries

3. Challenge: Maintaining flexibility for future role changes
   Mitigation: Design a modular RBAC system that allows easy addition or modification of roles

4. Challenge: Preventing privilege escalation vulnerabilities
   Mitigation: Implement strict validation on role change operations and regularly perform security audits

5. Challenge: Handling existing users during RBAC implementation
   Mitigation: Develop a migration strategy to assign appropriate roles to existing users

Remember to update this document as you progress through the implementation. This will help maintain clear communication among the development team and ensure that all aspects of the role-based access control system are properly implemented.
