# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the specific changes, tasks, and progress for implementing the role-based access control system in our application.

## Changes to be Made

1. Database Schema
2. Authentication Configuration
3. Middleware Implementation
4. Frontend Components
5. API Routes
6. User Management
7. Logging and Monitoring

## Detailed Tasks and Progress

### 1. Database Schema
- [x] Add 'role' field to User model in Prisma schema
- [ ] Create a migration to update the database
- [ ] Apply the migration to the development database
- [ ] Update seed data to include roles (if applicable)

### 2. Authentication Configuration
- [ ] Modify auth.ts to include role in the session
- [ ] Add authorized callback to check user roles
- [ ] Update signIn callback to handle roles
- [ ] Update session callback to include role information

### 3. Middleware Implementation
- [ ] Create a new middleware function for role-based access control
- [ ] Implement logic to check user roles against required roles for routes
- [ ] Add middleware to protected routes

### 4. Frontend Components
- [ ] Create separate dashboard views for each role (User, Supervisor, Admin)
- [ ] Implement conditional rendering based on user roles
- [ ] Update navigation components to show/hide based on user role
- [ ] Create admin-only components for user management

### 5. API Routes
- [ ] Modify form creation/editing routes to check user roles
- [ ] Update form retrieval routes to filter based on user role
- [ ] Implement role checks in user management routes
- [ ] Add role-based checks to any other sensitive operations

### 6. User Management
- [ ] Create admin-only route for user creation
- [ ] Implement interface for admins to change user roles
- [ ] Add validation to ensure at least one admin always exists

### 7. Logging and Monitoring
- [ ] Implement detailed logging for role-based actions
- [ ] Create a system to alert admins of suspicious role-based activities
- [ ] Set up monitoring for failed access attempts due to insufficient roles

## Progress Tracking

- [ ] Database Schema: 25% complete
- [ ] Authentication Configuration: 0% complete
- [ ] Middleware Implementation: 0% complete
- [ ] Frontend Components: 0% complete
- [ ] API Routes: 0% complete
- [ ] User Management: 0% complete
- [ ] Logging and Monitoring: 0% complete

## Next Steps

1. Complete the database schema changes and run migrations
2. Update the authentication configuration in auth.ts
3. Implement the role-based access control middleware
4. Begin updating frontend components to respect user roles
5. Modify API routes to include role-based checks
6. Implement user management features for admins
7. Set up logging and monitoring for role-based actions

## Notes for Developers

- Always ensure that role checks are performed on both the client and server side
- Be cautious when changing role permissions, as it may affect existing users
- Regularly review and update this document as implementation progresses
- Consider the performance impact of role checks, especially on frequently accessed routes
- Implement thorough testing for each role to ensure proper access control

Remember to update this document as you progress through the implementation. This will help maintain clear communication among the development team and ensure that all aspects of the role-based access control system are properly implemented.
