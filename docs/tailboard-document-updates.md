## Testing Recommendations
1. Test all components with different user roles (ADMIN, SUPERVISOR, USER) to ensure proper access control and functionality.
2. Verify error handling by simulating various error scenarios (e.g., network errors, validation errors, unauthorized actions).
3. Test the creation, viewing, editing, and status changes of tailboard documents across different user roles.
4. Verify that confirmation dialogs appear and function correctly for status changes.
5. Test pagination, filtering, and searching functionality in the AdminTailboardList component.
6. Ensure that error messages and success notifications are displayed correctly and are user-friendly.

## Future Improvements
1. Implement unit tests for individual components and functions.
2. Add integration tests to verify the correct behavior of the tailboard document functionality across different user roles and scenarios.
3. Consider implementing real-time updates using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for collaborative editing of tailboard documents.
4. Enhance the UI/UX of the tailboard document forms and list views based on user feedback.
5. Implement a more robust caching strategy to improve performance, especially for frequently accessed data.
6. Consider adding a document versioning system to track changes in tailboard documents over time.

## Conclusion
These updates have significantly improved the error handling, user feedback, and overall reliability of the tailboard document feature. Continued testing and refinement based on user feedback will help ensure a smooth and efficient user experience.
